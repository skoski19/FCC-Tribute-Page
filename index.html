      <p>Wonder Woman is arguably the most famous female superhero out there — one with a colorful history through the years. Making her debut in the 1941’s All Star Comics No. 8, the character was created by William Moulton Marston, who envisioned her as the ideal love leader and the type of woman who should rule the world with the strength of Superman and the appeal of a good and beautiful woman. The comic book has been published by DC Comics for its entire run, apart from a brief hiatus in 1986.</p>
      <p>Created in response to the prominence of male super heroes at the time (Superman, Batman, Captain America) Marston hoped his female hero would inspire young kids — both girls and boys, although aimed slightly more towards the former — to become leaders through articles and features celebrating female empowerment. There were stories about the career paths of famous and accomplished ladies called the Wonder Women of History.</p>
      <p>Wonder Woman is viewed as a feminist icon, though her appearance is just as noteworthy. Her red, white, and blue star-spangled suit is among her most striking characteristics — though her beauty does not serve to downplay her strength — as well as one of the most famous costumes in comic books ever. The famous getup includes gauntlets of Atlas which increases the strength of the wearer by ten — these sometimes cause Diana trouble when it comes to controlling the sudden increase in strength. Another item in her weaponry repertoire is the Lasso of Truth: a lasso which forces people to tell the truth; can restore memories; get rid of or cause illusions to those it holds; heal the holder of insanity, and protect those in close proximity from magical attacks. A non-combat version can also be used to change Diana’s clothing. </p>
  <p>Wonder Woman tells the tale of Princess Diana of Themyscira. Her original origin story says she was formed out of clay by her mother, Hippolyta, and had life bestowed upon her by the Greek gods — making her the only Amazon not conceived by a man. She grows up free of men on the Paradise Island where the Amazons teach her warrior skills as well as lessons of love and peaces. The gods also gift Diana with powers including strength, wisdom and courage, a hunter’s heart, beauty, sisterhood, speed and flight.</p>
